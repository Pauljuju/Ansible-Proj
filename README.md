âœ… Security Setup

Created two Security Groups: one for the Ansible control node and one for the web servers.

Allowed SSH from IP and Ansible SG, and HTTP traffic to servers.

âœ… Provisioning

Launched Amazon Linux 2 EC2 as the Ansible controller.

Generated and imported SSH keys for secure connections.

âœ… Automation with Ansible

Installed Ansible on the control node.

Wrote an inventory file with private IPs of servers.

Created a simple playbook (deploy-techmax.yml) to install and start NGINX.

Verified reachability with ansible all -m ping.

âœ… Efficiency

Configured ansible.cfg to avoid repeating SSH options.

ðŸ”§ Outcome: With a single command (ansible-playbook deploy-techmax.yml), I automated the full deployment of a web server environment on AWS.
