1. create the ansible machine sg
    - ssh from ip

2. create the server sg 
    ssh from ansible sg
    http from port 80
    select ssh-customised port 22 - ansible master SG

3. launch the ansible-machine 
    amazon linux 2

4. create key pairs on the ansible-machine 
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

5. import public key into the ec2 console
    ansible-pub-key

6. launch the servers
    key pair: ansible-pub-key
    sg: server-sg 

7. test connection 
    change back to home directory, type pwd to verify
    ssh private ip

8. install ansible on ansible-machine
    sudo yum update -y
    Update: sudo yum install -y amazon-linux-extras
    Install/Enable: sudo amazon-linux-extras enable ansible2
                    sudo yum install ansible -y

9. create inventory file, copy and paste private Ips from Target Nodes to inventory

10. create playbook
    deploy-techm.yml

11. Ping to see if servers are reacheable 
    ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa -i inventory -m ping -u ec2-user

12. creat ansible.cfg file 
[defaults]
remote_user = ec2-user 
inventory = inventory 
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa

so anytime we want to reach svrs, we dont repeat them

13. run the ansible playbook
    chk svrs first, to see that site cant be reach - since nothing installed
    
    ansible-playbook deploy-techmax.yml
